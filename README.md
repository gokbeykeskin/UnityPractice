The small Unity Projects I created while learning intermediate Unity Scripting stuff.


## [ObserverSingleton Project](https://github.com/gokbeykeskin/UnityPractice/tree/main/ObserverSingleton)
Learning Goals:
- Delegates
- Unity Actions
- Events & Unity Events
- Singleton & Observer Design Pattern applications on Unity Game Development
Task: Print a Debug Line & Spawn a Cube each time a new scene is loaded using Unity Actions, Observer and Singleton Patterns together.
Also spawn a sapphire using Unity Events on top of the cube which gets the same color as the cube.
